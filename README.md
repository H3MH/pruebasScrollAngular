# Interested in taking over this project?

I haven't had time to maintain this project, and have all but stopped working on Angular projects, so if someone would like to take this over, I'm happy to transfer it over. Please contact me if interested.

# AnimateOnScrollTest

## Purpose

This is an example app for the Angular directive found at: [https://github.com/abhazelton/animate-on-scroll](https://github.com/abhazelton/animate-on-scroll).  It contains a few examples of how to implement the directive.

## Usage
This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.26.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
